### Image Editor, Mobile Apps & much more!

Hello,

It's been a while since we sent you our last update but rest assured we have been hard at work and we are super excited about this update.

**Image Editor**

No more filling painful creative requisition forms to make minor tweaks to your ad creatives. Want to add a New Call to Action or promote a new offer like “20% off only for this weekend!” You can now do these changes right on our platform.

**SPA - Static Product Ads**

What if you could create 100s of ads at once and not have to upload each creative manually? Presenting Static Product Ads (SPA) - similar to DPA, you can use your product feed to create ads with regular audience targeting. Combined with our Image Editor, we have seen great lift in ad performance for both DPA and SPA with our beta customers and today we are proud to roll it out to everyone!

**Mobile App**

Remember? In the earlier product update, we promised to roll our mobile app for you to look at the stats on the go or even toggle your campaigns/adsets on-off. [Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.adwyze109328&hl=en) today from the Android Playstore.

Care for iOS app? Let us know!


**Custom Names and UTM parameters**

You have asked for this and we listened. Customise the names AdWyze chooses for your campaigns/adsets/ads as well as take control of your utm parameters. To setup, go to Company preferences → Naming convention.


Moving ahead, you can follow our product updates as they happen [here](http://docs.adwyze.com/updates/).

What do you think about these updates - more importantly I'd love for you to use the new image editor with SPA and DPA ads and let us know how it worked for you. Feel free to reach out to us with any questions and feedback.


Thank you,

AdWyze Team
