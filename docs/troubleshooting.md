### Why don't I see my campaigns in AdWyze?

If you have already linkedin your facebook accounts and see the campaigns not displaying, it could with the current active account. Click on the top right corner and choose the correct facebook ad account for which you have the campaigns. Once selected you should be seeing all you campaigns, adsets and ads of that account.


### Unable to create fb campaigns

Your company's account is not connected with a facebook page id. You can use campaign creation but will not be able to publish ad. Contact the engineering team for assistance.

If that's the error you are seeing, then you should be linking your facebook pages

### Why don't the numbers match between GA & Adwyze ?
This occurs if you have some campaigns created out of AdWyze platform without the utm tags added correctly. 
We need all these utm tags mapped correctly.

 - utm_source
 - utm_medium
 - utm_keyword
 - utm_term
 - utm_content
