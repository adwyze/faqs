1. Go to Created → Ad creation
2. Choose a global template (you can save ad settings as global templates to reuse)
3. Create facebook ads
4. Create Instragram ads - You do not need to link your instagram account. The instagram accounts run from your linked facebook ad account



### What are global templates?
You campaign settings can be reused (cloned to save time) allowing you to modify only the fields that you want to change while creating a new campaign.


### How to create global templates?
At the final step of campaign creation, you can save the entire template - campaign, targeting, ads, pricing & schedule as a single global template. The next time you want to create a campaign, you can directly choose this global template from the dropdown and all the entire template loads. Proceed with necessary changes (in campaign, targeting, ad or scheduling sections) and publish. You can also save this modified template as a new global template again.


### Product Sets
To create new product setgs, go to **creation → product sets → choose feed → add new set**


### Custom Audience
In addition to creating templates for audience based on the targeting & split rules you have while creating a campaign, you can also create new audience set and choose this audience set while creating campaigns.


Types of custom audience currently supported
- Emails
- Phone numbers
- Advertiser ids (coming soon!)
	
To create custom audience, click on creation → custom audience.
Give a name for the audience group, choose whether these are emails or phone numbers and copy/paste the list to create new audience group.

This ad gets saved in the adset.

into adsets of any existing campaign.
