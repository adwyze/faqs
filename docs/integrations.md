### Server-to-Server (s2s)
It's now possible to integrate your custom analytics with the new server-to-server (s2s) integration. We created an api for you to send custom metrics. We also released 'show API' for you to see what data we are storing on our platform. Take a look at this [integration guide](https://platform.adwyze.com/docs/v1/index.html) to connect your analytics to AdWyze.
