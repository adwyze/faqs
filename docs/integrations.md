can access information from your Appsflyer account to show it in the dashboard.


### Server-to-Server (s2s)

It's now possible to integrate your custom analytics with the new server-to-server (s2s) integration. We created an api for you to send custom metrics. We also released 'show API' for you to see what data we are storing on our platform. Take a look at this [integration guide](https://platform.adwyze.com/docs/v1/index.html) to connect your analytics to AdWyze.

Your app id and secret are generated. Keep them safe and use it for integrating with your custom analytics. Also, you can create custom metrics from this form.


### Twitter
Ability to run twitter ads is under development. We expect this feature to be rolled out in early 2016. If you are looking to run twitter campaigns, please contact us and we can add you to the beta list.
