# Creating Rules to automate your campaigns



### What is silence period?
Once a rule has been applied on adset then how long before it applies again on the same adset. E.g. if a rule increases bid by 5%. Then we need a silence period so that once a rule has applied, we wait for the silence period before applying the rule again even if the condition under which rule triggers is true.
