### Rules 
Rules help you to automate your campaigns, adsets and ads. This is a powerful feature to let you take automated actions based on multiple conditons occuring in your ad and analytics platforms.


### What is silence period?
Once a rule has been applied on adset then how long before it applies again on the same adset. E.g. if a rule increases bid by 5%. Then we need a silence period so that once a rule has applied, we wait for the silence period before applying the rule again even if the condition under which rule triggers is true.
